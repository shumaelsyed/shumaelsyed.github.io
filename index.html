				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<hr color=black>
			<p>
				I am a <strong>4th year Software Engineering</strong> student at the <strong>University of Ottawa</strong> in search for my next co-op placement. I am a career driven individual focused on broadening and enhancing my skills on a daily basis. I have a passion for providing innovative solutions with my knowledge of programming and testing. As a Software Engineer, I have experience with all levels of the software lifecycle which I can apply in numerous areas. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I am interested in mobile and web-based application development, data science, system architecture, quantitative analysis and automation. Additionally, I am also interested in product management and business development and enjoy complementing and discussing business strategy and current and upcoming technology trends and their effects. As this combination of interests makes obvious, I also have an interest in technology entrepreneurship. My other interests include economics, finance, and mathematics.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Always looking for opportunities to learn, to discuss interesting ideas, and to meet intelligent, motivated, ambitious people, so feel free to contact me!

					 <p>
                                                As my third co-op placement, I got the opportunity to work as a <strong>Software Developer at Royal Bank of Canada (RBC)</strong> in the DevOps team. As a developer within DevOps, I developed automated test scripts in Python using Selenium WebDriver for various DevOps tool. In addition, I developed scripts using REST APIs for real-time data collection to resolve audit-related issues. Furthermore, I implemented REST APIs in automated test scripts to increase efficiency and reliability to reduce the use of Selenium where possible. Over the course of 4 months, I was able to develop many scripts that were executed successfully in both development and production environments. 
                                        </p>
					<p>
						As my second co-op placement, I got the opportunity to work as an <strong>Infrastructure Engineer at House of Commons Canada</strong> in the Digital Services Team. During my time at the House of Commons, I completed and worked on a variety of projects ranging from infrastructure through documentation to testing of software on both mobile and PC-based projects. Specifically, I developed new documentation for software which was in or was headed into production within the department. In addition, I worked tirelessly with clients and product line managers to improve user experience (UX) with the help of constructive feedback. Over the course of 4 months, I was able to develop new documentation and test cases for a multitude of software and applications. 
					</p>
					<p>
						As my first co-op placement, I was fortunate enough to work as a <strong>Software Test Engineer at Global Affairs Canada</strong> in the Quality Assurance and Quality Control Team. Along with completing the work I was assigned, I wanted to leave a lasting impact within the team. At the time of my employment, Global Affairs was in a transitionary period in which they were upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I used my years of experience with Windows 10 operating system to develop and document many new test cases that were used by myself and my collogues to ensure the transition from Windows 7 to Windows 10 was seamless within the Global Affairs department. In addition, I regularly completed various forms of software and hardware testing in which I interacted with 20+ applications and many different types of hardware. I was responsible for documenting all my findings, indicating any irregularities and developing further test cases to provide a better product for clients.
